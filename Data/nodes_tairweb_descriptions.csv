It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes.

The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) or  hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. A conserved TPP-binding site is located in the 3' UTR of the At2g29630.2 gene model, and is predicted to function as a riboswitch. The riboswitch controls the  formation of transcripts with alternative 3' UTR lengths, which affect mRNA accumulation and protein production.

Involved in the catabolism of proline to glutamate. Involved in protection from proline toxicity. Induced at pathogen infection sites. P5CDH and SRO5 (an overlapping gene in the sense orientation) generate 24-nt and 21-nt siRNAs, which together are components of a regulatory loop controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and stress response."

In Arabidopsis, DXR is encoded by a single-copy gene. Arabidopsis  DXR is targeted to plastids and localizes into chloroplasts of leaf cells. DXR knockout or strongly silenced lines have a seedling lethal, albino phenotype. Transgenic, partially silenced lines expressing 35S:DXR have a variegated phenotype."

AT5G63840,AT5G63840,"GLUCOSIDASE 2 ALPHA,  GSCIIALPHA,  PRIORITY IN SWEET LIFE 5,  PSL5,  RADIAL SWELLING 3,  RSW3",Encodes the alpha-subunit of a glucosidase II enzyme. A mutant has been shown to be specifically impaired in cellulose production.
AT5G63890,AT5G63890,"ATHDH,  HDH,  HISN8,  HISTIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS 8,  HISTIDINOL DEHYDROGENASE",Encodes histidinol dehydrogenase. Up-regulated in response to UV-B.
AT5G63910,AT5G63910,"FARNESYLCYSTEINE LYASE,  FCLY","Encodes a farnesylcysteine lyase (EC 1.8.3.5) involved in a salvage /detoxification pathway of farnesylcysteine (FC) residues that are liberated during the degradation of prenylated proteins. Because FC is a competitive inhibitor of prenylcysteine methyltransferases involved in the down-regulation of ABA signaling, fcly mutants with elevated FC levels are hypersensitive to ABA. The protein also appears to be glycosylated when translated in vitro in the presence of microsomal membranes and it likely requires FAD for enzymatic activity."
